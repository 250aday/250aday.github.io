Today is the first day of June, the beginning of the summer.

My second son is a week old. My first son is going to be three in a couple months. My wife, who just had a C-section, just finished the semester of seminary, and has two (part-time) years left.

We are mostly broke.

I have been working as a freelance writer for the last year and a half, which provides a lot of flexibility, but not much stable income. I haven't really been making enough to live on --- we have slowly used up the money we got from selling the house to move to seminary. My children are on Medicaid, and we are starting to look into food stamps, WIC, and any other benefits we can get.

Even with that, I'm not sure that my average income level up to this point is enough. We _might_ be able to scrape by, but it is probable we cannot.

I get paid, mostly, by the word. To make enough money to pay all of our bills, I need to write about 10,000 words in a week. During the summer time, when my wife is not in classes, this is doable but not easy. During the school year, when I have to watch our child(ren) during classes, I have found it damn near impossible. Even on my most productive weeks, I can't manage it --- and most of my weeks are not my most productive ones.

## Something needs to change

Something needs to change. As far as I can tell, that something is me.

I need to radically increase my earning power in the time available. During the school year, I have about 25 hours of available time each week --- so there's nearly zero capacity for either self-improvement or asset building. That means that the summer --- this summer --- is a limited window of opportunity during which I need to build something, some income stream or asset that will allow me to earn enough money each week in 20&ndash;30 hours. Since this is [6 times more than Tim Ferriss thinks I should need](http://amzn.to/25sG9O3), I have to think I can do it.

## What are my needs and goals?

At a bare minimum, I need to make _about_ $1000 a week. I live in Berkeley, so this is actually not very much. We are lucky in that we live in below-market housing here at [the seminary](http://cdsp.edu/), so roughly $50K a year is actually enough. But just barely.

$1000/wk works out to $200/day, assuming I only work on weekdays, and further assuming I am only making money while actively working (my current situation). A huge part of my goal is to be able to make money _even when I am not actively working_ (to decouple income from direct hourly effort), so I want to earn $X _every day_, not just every weekday.

Finally, since $200 is barely cutting it, I have decided this needs to be increased to $250/day. It is simple to do the math on this to figure out what it would mean for my monthly and yearly income if I were to achieve this, but I have (so far) deliberately not done the math. I don't want to think about that. I just want to think about **$250 a day, every day**.

## Additional considerations, limitations, etc...

I have previously been lucratively employed. Why not simply try to get a high-paying job now?

I have spent a lot of time considering this path, and I have applied for several jobs. However, there are a number of mitigating factors for me and conventional employment. They boil down to:

 - Given my wife's school schedule we would need to hire babysitters or pay for daycare, were I to have a full time job with normal hours. This significantly increases the lowest salary I can reasonably afford to work for.

 - Having now experienced both work-from-home and work-at-office lifestyles, I have developed a pretty strong desire to stay at home. Given commute times in the Bay Area, and my older son's schedule, having a full-time job would likely mean only seeing him on the weekend. That is unacceptable.

So the requirements are:

 - flexible time
 - flexible location
 - enough money

This is, of course, everyone's list for a dream job. Lucky me, I'm at a point in my life where "live the dream" is the only viable option. Actually --- I'm counting on this fact. I have found in the past that having no option but to succeed is sometimes the only way to do so.

## What skills and present assets do I have that will help?

I don't really have any extra money to spend right now, so I have to make do with what I have. And I don't have a lot of extra time to learn new skills, so I have to figure out how to combine my current skills into something useful.

So let's figure out what I have and know how to do:

### Personal Skills

 - Moderate web design and deployment skills
    - WordPress
    - Jekyll
    - Nikola
 - Writing ability, especially blogging and medium-length non-fiction
 - Basic knowledge of internet marketing:
    - Email (mailchimp)
    - Social Media (a bit)
    - PPC ads (also a bit)
    - SEO (I _think_ I know a lot, but it hasn't been tested much in real life)
    - Affiliate marketing (as in, I know what it is, and have casually engaged in it during my hobby blogging)
 - Very moderate programming capability (I can write a WordPress plugin if I need to; I can [use Python to boost my personal productivity](http://amzn.to/1TGxYmm))
 - Past experience in:
    - Project Management
    - Financial Services
    - Sales
    - Publishing

Basically it is a hodgepodge of having dabbled in a bit of internetty things, and also having read a lot more than I have actually accomplished. None of this is enough to get a great job here in the Bay Area (as far as I can tell --- and I have tried), but I _feel_ like it is enough of a nexus to build my own something.

### Useful "assets"

Because of some past projects, and wishful thinking, I have:

 - A [Bluehost shared hosting account](http://bluehost.com/track/socialbootstrap), already paid up for a while;
 - Way too many interesting domain names;
 - A paid-up-forever membership to [WPMUDev](https://premium.wpmudev.org/).

### Putting that together to do...?

So, I seem to be a perfect candidate for a Four Hour Work-Week, get-rich-on-the-internet life, no?

I have started a number of projects that I hoped would turn into online businesses. I can't say that any of them have failed, because actually I haven't seen them all the way through to the point where they could have been either failures or successes. (Perhaps in a future post I'll explore some of the personal reasons for this, and how I'm working to overcome them.)

At any rate, I _think_ that the most reasonable path toward **$250 a day** is affiliate marketing. However, this is subject to change.

## What is this post and blog about?

I'm writing this for two people: myself, and you.

Most of all, it is for myself. I need a methodical way to track my progress toward this goal: $250 a day. I need a record of what I have _actually_ done, not just what I have thought about. I need a place to work out my vague ideas and turn them into an actionable plan. I need a space to talk through my own personal hangups, fears, mental blocks, and all the other things that have so far kept me from getting anywhere meaningful with these sorts of projects in the past. If it gains any audience at all, I will be greatly helped by being held accountable in public.

Secondarily, this will be valuable to others --- to you. I have read a number of books about success and getting rich online and starting businesses --- you know the genre. They are always written after the fact. They gloss over a lot of detail in order to craft a compelling narrative, teach a few hopefully helpful lessons, and sell well. Causal relationships are sketchy at best. The sense of inevitability makes it difficult to relate to.

This online journal begins, publicly, with no guarantee of success. My goal might change. My plans almost certainly will. Failures, false starts, terrible ideas, and wasted time will all be recorded for posterity. If it ends up working out --- if I actually hit $250 a day --- then there will be a record, a path for others to learn from. If not, well --- at least you'll know some things not to do.

Naturally, this circles back around to benefitting me again. If this story takes off, it could --- potentially --- be a source of income unto itself. I have always found the "making money by talking about making money" phenomenon (especially in the "making money online" subculture) to be huckster's playground, but here I am. I can't help but hope that this works, that I get two successes for the price of one.

## The plan

Here is where I make some promises to myself, and to anyone who might be reading, about what I will be doing to achieve my goal(s).

 - Write here at least once a day, describing what I have actually done that day.
 - As much as possible, all planning and thinking through what to do will be done on this blog.
 - In the near future, I will post about my current plan --- what products I'm planning to  sell, what affiliate networks I'm joining, tech I'm going to be using, and general strategy and tactics.
 - Results --- clicks, visitors, sales, income, whatever --- will be made as public as possible.
 - Any tools or scripts I personally develop (hey, it's possible!) will be Open Sourced and made available on [Github](https://github.com/250aday).
 - Books I read, blog posts I find instructive, products I buy, and people who help me will all be mentioned.

I will be journalling and working through things in real time. Posts will _not_ be edited for narrative flow or to be particularly impactful to an audience. I'll try to do a quick once-over for spelling and grammar errors. But --- the whole point of this is for me to have a place to think through things and, secondarily, to let other people in on the thought process. That means little to no editing or censorship.

This blog is not the product. This blog is the process. (I have to keep reminding myself of that:  for example, I just spent _way too long_ picking out a Jekyll theme.)

## Can you help?

So, basically, I don't really know what I'm doing. If you have any advice, ideas, or general pointers --- _please_ share them in the comments.

Thanks.
