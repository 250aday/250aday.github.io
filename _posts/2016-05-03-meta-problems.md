I (sort of) [have a plan for getting to $250 a day](http://250aday.github.io/2016-06-02-initial-plan/). And I'm starting to execute on that plan.

But, as always, this is the part where my neuroticism kicks in and I start inventing problems. Here's the problems I have so far invented:

 - Almost no one is reading _this blog_ about my progress. Like two people so far. So I am fighting the urge to spend a bunch of time and energy figuring out how to get traffic here.
 - I can't find a WordPress theme I like for my primary site. Since I have WP skills, I am _extremely_ tempted to spend the next week or two designing my own theme. Almost certainly this is a terrible idea.
 - I'm not sure I like the domain name I have already for [my target niche](http://250aday.github.io/2016-06-01-finding-niche/).
 - I'm having general doubts about my plan, my goal, and also whether affiliate marketing is even a good idea to begin with.
 - I'm reading too much.

The domain name issue is easy to solve --- I can afford [$8 to get a new domain name](https://www.namesilo.com/pricing.php?rid=b985a52rr).

I'm thinking about adding a few outposts (Facebook, Twitter) for this blog, just so I feel like I did _something_.

I need to just bite the bullet and get started with some vaguely decent theme. I can buy or build a better one later. _Get over yourself, Adam._

My doubts about all this... work through them, work through them. I have no plan for overcoming these feelings. I will just need to work through them.

I have got to stop reading about affiliate marketing. At least for, like, three weeks. I'm not going to find a piece of information that will actually be helpful until I get my site up and have _something_ to work on.

When I [started this project](http://250aday.github.io/2016-05-31-intro-goal/), I said:

> Something needs to change. As far as I can tell, that something is me.

It is more and more obvious to me that this is the real challenge.
