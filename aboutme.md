My name is Adam Michael Wood. I'm a writer, web developer, and project manager. I'm also a church musician, composer, liturgist, theologian, and philosopher. Also a dad and husband.

This blog is a record of my personal journey towards automating my income so that I can $250 a day with minimal time spent each week.

If you want to learn more about me, see my personal website: [adammichaelwood.com](http://adammichaelwood.com).
